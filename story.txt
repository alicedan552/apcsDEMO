There once was a cat named Lucky. This was a tabby cat. He was very playful and curious, and he especially loved playing with yarn. One day, Lucky's yarn completely unraveled. Lucky was sad because all he could play with was a very long piece of string: nothing to roll, nothing much to do. This is a tragic story. Moral: make the most of what you have while you still can, but use your resources wisely...
